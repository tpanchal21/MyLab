#docker run -p 9000:8080 mylambda

#COMMANDS TO PUSH TO ECR 
#   Use the following steps to authenticate and push an image to your repository. For additional registry authentication methods, including the Amazon ECR credential helper, see Registry Authentication .
#   Retrieve an authentication token and authenticate your Docker client to your registry. Use the AWS CLI:

#    aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-1 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin 302263053598.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
#    Note: If you receive an error using the AWS CLI, make sure that you have the latest version of the AWS CLI and Docker installed.
#    Build your Docker image using the following command. For information on building a Docker file from scratch see the instructions here . You can skip this step if your image is already built:
    
#    docker build -t genai/myrepo .
#    After the build completes, tag your image so you can push the image to this repository:
    
#    docker tag genai/myrepo:latest 302263053598.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/genai/myrepo:latest
#    Run the following command to push this image to your newly created AWS repository:
    
#    docker push 302263053598.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/genai/myrepo:latest
