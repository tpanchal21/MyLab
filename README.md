# ChatbotUsingLanggraph.ipynb #

The code demonstrate the chatbot implemented using langgraph and openai model. It also Visualizes the full workflow using LangGraph by representing the steps as nodes and transitions as edges.

# first_ML_project.ipynb #

The code imports the pandas library and loads a dataset (delaney_solubility_with_descriptors.csv) into a DataFrame (df). It does Target and Features Separation. The dataset is split into training and testing sets (80% training, 20% testing) using train_test_split from sklearn. Model is build using Linear regression and Random forest. The code ends with Model comparison in single datafram and data visualization.

Code demonstrates a basic workflow for a machine learning project, including data loading, preparation, model training (for Linear Regression and Random Forest), performance evaluation, and visualization of the results.

# bedrock_converse_api.ipynb #

code demonstrates how to interact with various AI models available through the Amazon Bedrock API using the Boto3 library. It includes functionalities for invoking models, handling conversations, and processing inputs such as text, images, and documents.

# sagemaker-rerank.ipynb #

code illustrates how to set up and utilize the Cohere Rerank model within the AWS SageMaker environment for document ranking based on a user query.
