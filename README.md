# first_ML_project.ipynb #

The code imports the pandas library and loads a dataset (delaney_solubility_with_descriptors.csv) into a DataFrame (df). It does Target and Features Separation. The dataset is split into training and testing sets (80% training, 20% testing) using train_test_split from sklearn. Model is build using Linear regression and Random forest. The code ends with Model comparison in single datafram and data visualization.

Code demonstrates a basic workflow for a machine learning project, including data loading, preparation, model training (for Linear Regression and Random Forest), performance evaluation, and visualization of the results.
